TODO:
- Remove need to create variable and payload headers on heap.

SAMPLES
- Add configs view.
- Improve connection url (URL & Port separation).

MEMORY & OPTIMIZATIONS
- Memory profiling.

Other
- Documentation
- Github actions: CI/CD (Builds, Tests, Code Analysis, etc).
- API Integration tests (with a test MQTT broker, maybe use docker).
- Authorization interface? (Reason code `Not authorized` can be sent by client in PUBACK, PUBREC)


***FUTURE TASKS**********************************************

1.Persistant Storage For Session State (Disk Write, WAL(Write Ahead Log))
	Delay Reason: Not added by default, requires some design work, but SDK can function without this feature. Work required involves Async operations
	for file system and making sure SDK reacts correctly to persistant storage operations completing. This would change the way publish acknowledgements
	are handled compared to the current implementation.

	Comments:
		- Filesystem wrappers for supported platforms.
		- Update interface for persistant storage, allow asynchronous operations.
		- Amend client to send publish acknowledgements after persistant storage operations complete rather than when application layer receives the message.
		- Add concept of client side acknowledging publish messages to allow SDK
